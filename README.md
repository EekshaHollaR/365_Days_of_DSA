# 🚀 365 Days of DSA Challenge

Welcome to my journey of mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**, one day at a time! This repository contains 365 curated files, each representing a daily DSA problem, its solution, and learning notes.

## 📚 What to Expect

Each daily file includes:
- ✅ A coding problem (easy, medium, or hard)
- 🧠 My thought process and approach
- 🧪 Solution(s) with comments
- 📈 Time and space complexity analysis
- ✍️ Notes or observations

## 📚 What's Inside

Each day's folder contains:
- 📖 Problem statement
- 💡 Solution in Java
- 🔍 Complexity analysis (Time and Space)
- 📝 Notes and observations


## 🎯 Goals

- Build strong fundamentals in DSA
- Prepare for technical interviews and coding contests
- Improve problem-solving and analytical thinking

## 🛠️ How to Run

Each solution is written in Java. To compile and run any file:

```bash
javac fileName.java
java fileName
